## Appcelerator Device Tracker project.

This project was created with the idea that we could keep track of all Appcelerator test devices.
Each device has it's own unique barcode and each user/developer has their own unique barcode.

The barcodes supported by the scanner are: EAN, UPC and QR codes

### How To Use:

##### To assign a device to yourself for testing:
1. Scan your own barcode.
2. Scan all the devices you wish to use.
3. Double tap the screen to assign the devices to yourself.

##### To remove a device from yourself:
1. Scan the devices you wish to return to the device cabinet.
2. Double tap the screen to remove the devices from yourself.

##### If you wish to remove devices from yourself while taking out more devices:
1. Scan your own barcode.
2. Scan the devices you want to return.
3. Scan the devices you want to use.
4. Double tap the screen to assign the devices accordingly.
(You can scan the devices in any order, the app will figure out which device is to be returned and which is to be assigned)

##### Check if the device you want is available:
1. Open the table view by selecting the second tab.
2. Select the platform you are looking for.
3. Find the device you wish to use (Devices are listed in order of the OS version)
4. Select the device and information about the device will be displayed.

##### If you find a device around the office that is no longer in use:
1. If you wish to use the device, scan your barcode and then scan the device QR code, then double tap the screen.
2. If you wish to return the device, scan the device barcode and double tap the screen.

##### If you want to transfer a device from one user/developer to another:
1. The user/developer who wishes to use the device scans their barcode, then scan the device barcode.
2. Double tap the screen.
(The device will be removed from the old user and attached to the new user)

##### If you have lost your unique barcode:
1. Log in using the 'Log In' button.
2. Scan the devices you wish to use.
3. Double tap the screen to assign the devices accordingly.
4. Log out using the 'Log Out' button.
